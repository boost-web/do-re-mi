This is test code for test-branch2

is this a good place to remove text and add it for test-branch?

    Let's start at the very beginning
    I just deleted code and add some other code with test-branch2
    When you sing you begin with do-re-mi
	
	-- Test-branch is adding this line

    Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
    The first three notes just happen to be
    Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
	
	**This is more code I'm testing with test-branch2 1
	
	let's add code here for test-branch

Like the alphabet or the scale, this repository isn't meant to be anything useful.  It just contains a few separate branches that you can merge or rebase together until you're comfortable with how those operations work.
